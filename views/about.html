    <p>Here's to alcohol, the cause of — and solution to — all life's problems. When will <strong>I</strong> learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV! <strong>Brace yourselves gentlemen</strong>. According to the gas chromatograph, the secret ingredient is… Love!? Who's been screwing with this thing?</p>
    <p>Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to <strong>kill mockingbirds!</strong> Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me? How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to <strong>drive?</strong></p>
    <p>Uh, no, you got the <strong>wrong number</strong>. This is 9-1…2. …And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.</p>
    <p>Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train! They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day. Me fail English? That's unpossible. I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the…uh…what cures cancer?</p>
    <p>Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a <strong>Nobel Prize</strong> for attempted chemistry? Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals…except the weasel.</p>
